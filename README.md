# Python Terminal Game
This a short Harry Potter Quiz that asks the user their House and tracks the score.

## Why this Project?
I am a Potterhead, I grew up with the books, delved deep into the realms of HP fanfiction, and collect the Lego.
(I **will** watch the films, but they're not the best thing about the franchise.)
So, it seemed like a logical step to incorporate a theme I am comfortable with to aid in practicing the concepts 
taught so far in the Computer Science track by Codecademy.

## Features
A simple CLI Quiz that:
- Asks 10 multiple choice questions
- Tracks score
- Awards points to the users Hogwarts House

## Tech Breakdown
I plan to use classes to model questions, lists to store quiz data, and loops to run through them.
